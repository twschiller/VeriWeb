<h2><a name="def">What are preconditions and postconditions?</a></h2> 
 
<p>A precondition is an expression that must be true when a method is
called. For example, the following method has the
pre-condition <tt>x != null</tt>:</p>
 
<pre> 
String convertToString(Integer x){ return x.toString(); }
</pre> 
 
<p>because if <code>x</code> 
is <code>null</code>, <code>x.toString()</code> will cause
a <code>NullPointerException</code>.</p> 
 
<p>A postconditions is an expression that describes what must be true
when a method returns. For example, the following method has the
postcondition <tt>\result == (x == 5)</tt>:</p> 
 
<pre> 
boolean isFive(int x){ return x == 5; }
</pre> 
 
<p>because the method returns whether or not <code>x</code> 
equals <code>5</code>.</p> 
				
<p><b>NOTE: Preconditions and postconditions can only refer to method
parameters and object fields (member variables).</b></p>

<h2><a name="satisfy-pre">I can't satisfy one of the method's
preconditions, what should I do?</a></h2>
					
<p>Either (1) the condition you need isn't listed or (2) the
precondition is bad:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A precondition you need for the current method isn't listed:
    take a look at our answer to the
    question <a href="#where-condition">Where is the condition I
    need?</a></li>
  <li>The precondition is bad, view the documentation
    for the corresponding method and click the "Mark as Bad" button
    next to the pre-condition. We'll ask you to describe the bad
    condition so that we can tell someone (maybe even you) to remove
    it.</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="observers">Why doesn't the system know anything about the
methods that are called by this method?</a></h2>
					
<p>The system can't always guess conditions automatically, so we need
people like you add them for us. To view what the system knows about a
method's conditions, view the method's documentation by hovering your
mouse over the method name. You can also toggle the inline
documentation for some methods by clicking on the method name &mdash;
this will show both facts that that system hasn't been able to prove
yet and facts that are known to be false.</p>
					
<p>It could be that the system doesn't know that calling the method
preserves / establishes the property you're interested in. To tell it,
view the documentation for the method and click the "Add" button next
to the list of preconditions; we'll ask you to describe the condition
so that we can tell someone (maybe even you) to add it.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="observer-ex">Why does the system think that a method that
is called by this method will throw an exception?</a></h2>

<p>For methods that throw exceptions, the system may not fully
understand under what circumstances an exception is thrown. To tell
it, view the documentation for the method and click the "Add" button
next to the exceptional postconditions; we'll ask you to describe the
condition so that we can tell someone (maybe even you) to add it.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="messages">What are these messages from other methods?</a></h2>

<p>A user working on a different problem thought that this method was
either missing a condition or that one of the conditions was
wrong. The messages explain which conditions they thought were
missing or incorrect.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="boxes">What are the colored boxes that contain
conditions?</a></h2>
			
<p>The conditions you submit are displayed here; we'll sometimes try
out some conditions automatically for you, too.</p>

<p>Conditions in green have been accepted by the system, whereas
conditions in red have been rejected by the system. A blue information
icon "i" will appear next to a condition when we can tell you why the
condition was rejected.  Hover your mouse over the information icon to see
the reason.</p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="selectreq-messages">Select Requires: What are these
messages above?</a></h2>

<p>A user working on a different problem thought that one of the
preconditions for this method was too restrictive (or just plain
wrong). The messages above show which precondition they thought was
bad along with an explanation of why they thought it was bad.</p>

<p><a href="#faq">Back to top</a></p>

<hr>
<h2><a name="where-condition">Select Requires: Where is the condition
I need?</a></h2>

<p>The conditions shown above were either guessed by us or entered by
another user. If you think a necessary condition is missing, click the
"Condition Not Listed" button; we'll ask you to describe the missing
condition so that we can tell someone else (maybe even you) to add
it.</p>
